    <string name="appExplanationText">This App allows the user to submit images taken with a
        microscope, in order to detect the presence of enteric parasites in human stool samples. This App is
        intended to help in coprological analysis.</string>

    <string name="howItWorksText">This App makes use of a machine learning algorithm to automatically
        detect parasites in stool samples. \n\nThe App requires a .jpg image taken at 40x, which is
        sent to the algorithm in order to be meticulously analysed and processed. If everything goes
        according to plan, you will see the same picture displayed, but with annotations surrounding
        the microorganisms which were found by the algorithm. \n\nAfter that, the annotated image
        will be saved to a database for research purposes, and you can also save it to your Camera Roll!</string>
    <string name="listOfParasitesIntroductionText">This App, with the use of machine learning
        technology, can detect many different species of parasites that are occasionally present
        in human stool.</string>
